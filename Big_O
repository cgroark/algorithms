Big O Notation tells you how fast an algorithm will take to run 
//and helps understand how much more time it will take as the list of search elements increases
//important to understand how running time increases as size of list increases

HELPS YOU COMPARE THE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS

you measure algorithms in the growth of the number of operations 

the n in O(n) stands for the number of operations
